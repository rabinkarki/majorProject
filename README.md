# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Environment variables allow you to configure your application for different environments (development, testing, staging, production) without changing the code. For example, you might have different API endpoints or feature flags for different environments.

Hardcoding values in your application can lead to maintenance difficulties and errors. Environment variables provide a centralized place to manage these values, making your code cleaner and easier to maintain.
storing sensitive information such as API keys, database connection strings, and secret tokens directly in your source code is not secure.
